      I know Andy from his community work with open source events like Open Source Summit and AI_Dev where he has served as program committee member. He is a passionate supporter of open source and has independently promoted open source through his outreach to groups like students at the University of Washington Foster School of Business. Andy is approachable and collaborative, and wonderful to work with. I know I can count on Andy to provide support in community endeavors as well as initiate relationships to make open source even stronger. I love that he is receptive to making new connections, and I was able to connect him to projects like GenAI Commons and PyTorch. Andy is truly an asset to open source communities.
