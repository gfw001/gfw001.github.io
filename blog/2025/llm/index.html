            <h2>1. Open Source vs Closed Source Foundation Model</h2>
            <p>2025 has been a year of dramatic shifts in the foundation model landscape. While we've seen more powerful models from <strong>Anthropic</strong> (Claude Opus 4.5) and <strong>OpenAI</strong> (GPT-5 series), the battle between open source and closed source has taken unexpected turns. Companies like <strong>Meta</strong> and <strong>xAI</strong> switched their previously open-source models to closed source. In a surprising move, OpenAI shipped <strong>gpt-oss</strong> in August 2025, marking their first major open-source model release.</p>

            <h3>My Favorite: DeepSeek Leading the Open Source Wave</h3>
            <p>Despite these industry shifts, my favorite AI breakthrough this year remains <a href="https://pengandy.com/blog/2025/deepseek/" target="_blank">DeepSeek</a>. DeepSeek proved that <strong>open source is the way</strong>. Their unwavering commitment to openness, even as giants like Meta retreated, has inspired a new generation of open-source models including <strong>Qwen</strong>, <strong>Kimi</strong>, <strong>Xiaomi MiMo</strong>, and <strong>AI2's OLMo</strong>. Open source enables innovation, research, and democratization of AI technology.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>2. Academia vs Industry Fusion</h2>

            <h3>NeurIPS 2025: A Milestone Conference</h3>
            <p>NeurIPS 2025 in San Diego was a crowded and hugely successful event, showcasing the vibrant intersection of academic research and industrial innovation. The conference highlighted both the opportunities and challenges facing the AI research community.</p>

            <h3>Supporting Critical Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>The community rallied to support <a href="https://openreview.net/forum/pineau%7Ca_message_from_ai_research_leaders_join_us_in_supporting_openreview" target="_blank">OpenReview</a>, the essential infrastructure for academic peer review. The <a href="https://blog.neurips.cc/2025/12/15/supporting-our-communitys-infrastructure-neurips-foundations-donation-to-openreview/" target="_blank">NeurIPS Foundation made a significant donation</a> to ensure its sustainability.</p>

            <h3>New Research Labs and Industry-Academia Partnerships</h3>
            <p><strong>Thinking Machines Lab</strong> (founded by former OpenAI CTO) and Amazon appointing <strong>Pieter Abbeel</strong> (UC Berkeley professor, co-founder of Covariant) to lead their frontier model research team signal a new era where boundaries between academic research and industrial innovation are increasingly fluid.</p>

            <h3>The Research vs Engineering Debate</h3>
            <p>The ongoing discussion about <a href="https://pengandy.com/blog/2025/RSRCHORENG/" target="_blank">research vs engineering</a> has intensified this year. We're seeing fascinating position changes between veterans and young researchers, reflecting the evolving landscape of AI careers.</p>

            <h3>The Rise of Young Leaders (95后)</h3>
            <p>2025 marks a watershed moment as more young researchers born after 1995 are becoming executives at major companies and startups, commanding compensation comparable to NBA stars in Bay Area tech. Notable examples include <strong>Shengjia Zhao</strong> (Chief Scientist at Meta Superintelligence Labs), <strong>Shunyu Yao (姚顺雨)</strong> at Tencent, and <strong>Fuli Luo (罗福莉)</strong> at Xiaomi. These leaders share a common profile: 95+ generation, former researchers at OpenAI or top labs like DeepSeek, PhD from Stanford or UC Berkeley, and undergraduate degrees from Tsinghua or Peking University.</p>

            <h3>The Great Talent Shuffle</h3>
            <p>We're witnessing a destructive restructuring (摧毁性的重构) of the AI talent landscape. In this new era, everyone needs to find their position. The traditional career paths are being rewritten, and adaptability has become the most valuable skill.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>3. Open Source Ecosystem in Place</h2>

            <h3>GPU-CPU Native Architecture</h3>
            <p>The shift toward <a href="https://pengandy.com/blog/2025/llmnative/" target="_blank">GPU-CPU Native</a> infrastructure has accelerated dramatically. Key projects driving this revolution include <strong>vLLM</strong>, <strong>SGLang</strong>, <strong>llm-d</strong>, <strong>Nvidia's Dynamo</strong>, and <strong>LMCache</strong>. Looking back at ATC 25, there was no concept of disaggregated inference at all. Just one year later, industry standards have emerged and are growing rapidly.</p>

            <h3>Linux Foundation and Open Source AI Community</h3>
            <p>The Linux Foundation and open-source AI community have remained incredibly active in 2025, driving both agentic AI and foundation model ecosystems forward. The <a href="https://pengandy.com/blog/2025/cncf10yo/" target="_blank">Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) turned 10</a> this year, marking a decade of open-source infrastructure innovation.</p>

            <h3>Timeline of Major Open Source AI Milestones</h3>
            <ul>
               <li><strong>December 2025</strong> - Linux Foundation announced the formation of the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), anchored by new project contributions including Model Context Protocol (MCP), goose, and AGENTS.md</li>
               <li><strong>October 30, 2025</strong> - LMCache joined PyTorch Foundation</li>
               <li><strong>October 22, 2025</strong> - Ray joined PyTorch Foundation</li>
               <li><strong>June 2025</strong> - Agent2Agent (A2A) project joined Linux Foundation</li>
               <li><strong>May 2025</strong> - vLLM and DeepSpeed accepted into the PyTorch Foundation</li>
               <li><strong>July 2024</strong> - vLLM joined Linux Foundation AI & Data</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>4. Agentic AI: Moving Fast</h2>
            <p>The industry consensus is clear: <strong>2025 is the year of the agent</strong>. We've seen an explosion of agentic AI frameworks, tools, and applications that are fundamentally changing how we think about AI systems.</p>
            <p>From autonomous coding assistants to multi-agent collaboration frameworks, agentic AI has moved from research novelty to production reality. The formation of the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) by the Linux Foundation signals that this trend is here to stay.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>5. Overhyped Products</h2>
            <p>Not everything that glitters is gold. <strong>Nano Banana</strong> and <strong>Amazon's Kiro</strong> fell short of expectations, heavily dependent on intensive prompting. These products remind us that innovation requires substance, not just sophisticated marketing.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>6. Productivity Tools: The Real Winners</h2>
            <p>While some products overpromised, others delivered genuine productivity gains. For coding, <strong>Cursor</strong> and <strong>Claude Code</strong> revolutionized development workflows. <strong>ChatGPT</strong> continued to excel at documentation and technical writing. <strong>Perplexity</strong> redefined knowledge management and information synthesis. These tools have proven their value through daily use, becoming indispensable parts of modern knowledge work.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>2025 has been a year of consolidation and maturation for the LLM ecosystem. From the triumph of open-source models to the restructuring of talent, from infrastructure standardization to the rise of agentic AI, we're witnessing the transformation of AI from emerging technology to essential infrastructure.</p>
            <p>As we look toward the future, the lessons are clear: open source enables innovation, community drives progress, and practical utility trumps hype. The foundation has been laid for an exciting 2026.</p>
