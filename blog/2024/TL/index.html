            <br> 
            <p>Two weeks ago, re:Invent concluded, and today marks the one-year milestone for me at Bedrock. As I reflect on the past year, it's a good moment to look back at both the highlights and the hurdles, the moments of happiness and those of frustration. Notably, Bedrock recently celebrated its first anniversary in October, a significant milestone that highlights the team’s rapid growth and impact.
Having been involved in building and founding several products at Amazon, I feel fortunate to be part of Bedrock, a cutting-edge product at this pivotal moment. It’s been an exciting journey of growth, collaboration, and learning, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to contribute to such a transformative initiative.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>L6 at Amazon</h2>
            <p>One of the most significant aspects of my time at Bedrock has been working closely with our external partner, Anthropic. From the start, Bedrock inference has been the only team working directly with Anthropic, and this unique partnership has involved a lot of confidential work. I remember an interesting moment when a L7 colleague slack-messaged me saying, "Andy, good to meet you. I’ve heard your name mentioned even by [XXX] (the co-founder of Anthropic), when we were working on this confidential P&C project." It’s always humbling to hear that your name is being discussed at such high levels.
</p>
            <p>Our collaboration with Anthropic has been deep and ongoing. This partnership led to some truly amazing product launches, such as the Computer Use, Haiku 3.5 Speed SKU on Trainium 2. I vividly recall several late nights where both teams worked tirelessly to debug issues, even staying up the entire night. Of course, the celebrations afterward at Seattle’s SLU for a successful launch were just as memorable.</p>
            <br> 
            <h2>Privilege, Confidentiality, and Exclusivity</h2>
            <p>Working so closely with Anthropic has come with a significant level of responsibility and confidentiality. Everything we do is considered privileged and confidential, and we have secured codebases, documents, channels, basically everything related to our work. This sense of exclusivity and responsibility reminds me of my time in Alexa (Device org), where access to certain departments required specific clearance.</p>
            <p>For nearly a year, our team’s work has been shrouded in secrecy. We’ve been unable to share much with others outside our direct teams, including other Bedrock teams. The good news is that people recognize the work we’ve done in delivering Claude models, and while the details are closely guarded, the results speak for themselves. Over time, we’ve become more accustomed to operating in this high-trust, high-privacy environment.</p>
            <br> 
            <h2>Claude on Trainium</h2>
            <p>This has been a significant milestone, and I feel privileged to have been deeply involved in several key aspects of this project over the past year. There were many unknowns and challenges along the way, but through careful setup, testing, and benchmarking, we worked closely with the Anthropic and Annapurna teams to achieve great results. The outcome turned out to be a big win, and it was exciting to see the announcement spread during re:Invent, especially after Peter’s <em>"Monday Night Live"</em> session. What’s interesting is a coincidence that occurred during this project: Because of my long-standing part-time contributions to the Linux Foundation community, I was invited to visit San Francisco as a member of the PyTorchCon Program Committee. While there, I participated in a panel discussion where James Bradbury, Head of Compute at Anthropic, was also a speaker. The following week, back in Seattle, I worked on tasks that involved several interactions with James. It felt like a serendipitous moment, and I couldn’t help but feel that this was exactly where I was meant to be.</p>
            <br> 
            <h2>Milestones and Deliverables: A Year of Innovation</h2>
            <p>I'm at Bedrock inference team, looking at the work we’ve accomplished, the list of deliverables is nothing short of impressive. In the past year, we’ve launched several significant products and features that have pushed the boundaries of AI and model inference. Some of the key milestones include:</p>
            <li>
              December: Claude 3.5 Haiku on AWS Trainium2 and model distillation in Amazon Bedrock.
            </li>
            <li>
              November: Anthropic and Palantir Partner to Bring Claude AI Models to AWS for U.S. Government Intelligence and Defense Operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              October: Upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet model from Anthropic, introducing groundbreaking Computer Use capabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              September: Claude models Provisioned Throughput.
            </li>
            <li>
              August: Amazon Bedrock offers select FMs for batch inference at 50% of on-demand inference price.
            </li>
            <li>
              July: Claude 3.5 Sonnet launched.
            </li>
            <li>
              June: Amazon Bedrock now available in London, São Paulo, and Canada (Central) regions.
            </li>
            <li>
              May: Claude 3 Sonnet and Haiku launched in Frankfurt.
            </li>
            <li>
              April: Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus model now available on Amazon Bedrock.
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>I’ve had the privilege of contributing to or leading these launches, and the pace of innovation here is intense. Each month brings one or two major launches, and this is just the external-facing work. Behind the scenes, there are countless internal deliverables that contribute to the overall momentum. While quarterly or yearly deliveries may have been the norm in the past, at Bedrock, it’s all about the monthly or bi-weekly cadence, with a constant push to meet what some may call "unreasonable" timelines. The complexity and effort required to meet these fast-paced expectations should never be underestimated.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>The Challenge of Workload and Communication</h2>
            <p>With the rapid delivery pace comes a significant challenge: workload. Bedrock and the broader GenAI department are known for their fast-paced environment, and this can lead to overload for many of us. One thing I’ve observed as a new joiner is that people, despite being incredibly busy, rarely reply to Slack messages. Initially, this felt uncomfortable, and I wondered if it was a sign of something personal. However, as I settled in, I realized that it’s simply a matter of time. There's just not enough bandwidth to keep up with every message, even when you want to support your team.</p>
            <p>In some ways, I've come to appreciate the return-to-office (RTO) setup, especially now that we have newly assigned desks in our Nitro North office building. With people in the office, it's easier to find colleagues and have quick, direct conversations. Junior team members can easily approach senior colleagues to ask questions and get help to overcome obstacles. This has improved our communication efficiency significantly.
Another interesting observation is the prevalence of cold calls in our culture. It’s not unusual to receive calls at any time from your colleagues, skip-level managers, or even GMs. On the very first day I joined Bedrock, I was already hosting design reviews and being asked to jump into tasks. This unique style of working can be intense but also fosters a sense of urgency and immediate engagement.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Team 3x</h2>
            <p>My manager's reports have tripled in the past few months, and he has also hired three new managers who now report to him. Bedrock is expanding rapidly, and with that growth comes the challenge of managing increasing complexity, new team members, and cross-country collaborations. As our team grows, balancing workloads and maintaining effective communication becomes a delicate art. Peer manager partnerships and collaboration are crucial, especially when coordinating across different time zones and cultural contexts.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>Let's talk a little bit about technology. Technically, I’ve always enjoyed working with bottom-layer technologies like LLM (Large Language Models). My previous experience spans various AWS products such as S3, Containers, and Virtulization, and I’ve found that working on fundamental technologies offers a unique sense of satisfaction. It’s exciting to see how the generative AI space is evolving, and I’m thrilled to be part of Bedrock at such a transformative moment in AI history.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Hiring and Interviews</h2>
            <p>In terms of recruitment, Bedrock is hiring aggressively, and I’ve had the opportunity to conduct numerous interviews. I’ve participated in over 110 interviews, with 40 of them specifically for Bedrock roles. Basically, as a L6 SDE, I conduct ~1 interview per week. I also went through the internal interview process when I transitioned from my previous team. I remember having 3-4 interview loops when I was deciding between teams SageMaker Inference, Bedrock Agent, and Bedrock Inference. Ultimately, I chose Bedrock Inference because I wanted to dive deep into the fundamentals and learn more about the core of generative AI.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Foresee</h2>
            <p>As we continue to grow, I foresee a future where AI models become even more deeply integrated into our daily lives. FM / LLM of today may increasingly resemble the browsers or everyday software applications we use, with future updates and iterations becoming as routine as downloading a new browser version from the App Store. In this highly competitive landscape, the version numbers of models from different providers could eventually resemble browser version numbers, reflecting regular updates and improvements. We also expect the boundary of knowledge within these models to shrink, making them accessible to a broader audience. As mentioned at re:Invent by Jason Clinton, CISO Anthropic, more innovations are expected to emerge in AI agents.</p>
            <p>Anthropic has done a significant amount of impactful work here, particularly with recent Model Context Protocol (MCP) and its Computer Use (apologies for mentioning it repeatedly, but it's an incredibly powerful feature). One of the papers I read about its potential exploration <em>“The Dawn of GUI Agent: A Preliminary Case Study with Claude 3.5 Computer Use”</em> by Show Lab at National University of Singapore, is definitely worth checking out. These efforts have played a crucial role in initializing the entire ecosystem.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>WLB</h2>
            <p>Balancing work and life is always a challenge, especially in a high-pressure environment like Bedrock. But I find that the excitement of working on such a transformative product makes it all worthwhile. The product we’re building has the potential to shape industries and change the way we interact with technology, and that gives me a deep sense of fulfillment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Overall, my first year at Bedrock has been an incredible journey. I’ve learned so much, faced new challenges, and contributed to innovative products that are making a real impact. I’m excited to see what the future holds as we continue to grow, innovate, and push the boundaries of what’s possible in the world of AI and cloud computing. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Thanks to Ben, James, Tim, Tommy, Evan, Nova, Jin, Frank, Josh, Justin, Ravi, Shashank, Mani, and everyone who worked alongside me this year.</p>
