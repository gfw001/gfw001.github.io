## Workflow

1. **Draft** - Write chapter content in .txt files here
2. **Edit** - Revise and polish the text
3. **Convert** - Transform to HTML format for publication
4. **Publish** - Add HTML files to `/novels/[novel-name]/chapters/`

## Notes

- Keep original .txt files here as source material
- These files are not published to the website
- Use these for backup and version tracking
