Chapter 1: The Extraction

The rain hadn't stopped in three days. It never really did in Seattle anymore, not since the atmospheric processors went online in '31. They said it was supposed to help with the heat, redistribute the moisture, save the planet one droplet at a time. What it really did was turn the city into a perpetual monsoon, washing away sins and secrets in equal measure down storm drains that couldn't keep up. I liked it that way. Rain was good for business.

My business was forgetting.

The basement lab was three levels below a Korean barbecue joint in Pioneer Square, accessible through a service elevator that officially didn't exist and a hallway that smelled like kimchi and industrial cleaner. The space itself was clean—antiseptic, even—because memory work required precision. One stray electromagnetic pulse, one contaminated neural pathway, and you weren't extracting memories anymore. You were creating them. Or worse, erasing things people wanted to keep.

I'd spent the last two hours prepping the rig for tonight's client. The extraction chair sat in the center of the room like a dentist's nightmare, all chrome and padding and neural interface points that would make anyone with a fear of needles pass out cold. Around it, monitors displayed readouts I'd memorized years ago: synaptic activity, temporal lobe mapping, hippocampal engagement levels. The quantum storage drives hummed in their cooling units along the wall, each one capable of holding a human lifetime of experiences. Most of mine held fragments. Pieces people wanted gone.

Marcus Drake. That was the name on my license, back when I had one. Now I was just the guy you called when you needed to forget, when the weight of what you'd done or seen or survived became too heavy to carry. The VA had trained me for this, back when memory extraction was still legal for PTSD treatment. They taught me how to navigate the architecture of human consciousness, how to find specific neural pathways and sever them clean. How to steal pieces of a person's soul and lock them away in a box.

Then the legislation changed. Too many rich people forgetting inconvenient testimonies. Too many crimes erased from the minds of witnesses. The technology went underground, and people like me went with it.

My phone buzzed at 11:47 PM. Right on time.

"The back entrance," I said without preamble. "Come alone."

The client didn't respond, just ended the call. They never wanted to talk more than necessary. The fact they were here at all meant they were desperate, and desperate people didn't waste time on pleasantries.

I moved to the security monitor and watched the alley camera. A black sedan pulled up, windows tinted dark enough to be illegal. The back door opened and a man stepped out into the rain, no umbrella, expensive suit already soaking through. He was tall, mid-forties, with the kind of haircut that cost more than my monthly rent. His face was familiar in that vague way that meant money—the kind of person you might see in a business journal or charity gala photo spread.

He moved quickly to the door, and I buzzed him in.

The sound of his footsteps echoed in the stairwell—Italian leather on concrete, each step deliberate and heavy. When he reached the bottom, I was waiting by the reinforced door, already sizing him up. Expensive suit, yes, but rumpled. Dark circles under bloodshot eyes. Hands trembling just slightly. Whatever he wanted to forget was eating him alive.

"Mr. Drake?" His voice was steady, practiced. A boardroom voice.

"Just Drake." I stepped aside to let him in. "You have the payment?"

He reached into his jacket—slowly, we both knew the protocol—and pulled out a credit stick. Cryptocurrency, untraceable. I scanned it with my reader. Fifty thousand dollars. My usual rate for a single extraction, no questions asked.

The transaction cleared, and I pocketed the stick. "This way."

I led him to the chair, watching the way his eyes moved around the room. Most clients were nervous, looking for hidden cameras or evidence that this was a setup. This one just looked tired, like he'd already resigned himself to what was about to happen.

"What's your name?" I asked, more out of habit than necessity. I didn't need to know, but it helped with the calibration.

"Does it matter?"

"No."

He sat down in the chair, and I saw his jaw tighten. "Call me... call me James."

"All right, James." I moved behind him and began attaching the neural interface leads to his temples, his occipital lobe, the base of his skull. Seventeen contact points total, each one calibrated to read the specific electromagnetic signatures of memory formation. "I need you to understand what's about to happen. This isn't like deleting a file. The memory will be extracted—copied, really—and then the neural pathways associated with it will be chemically suppressed. You'll still have the memory, technically, but you won't be able to access it. It'll be like trying to remember a dream that's already fading."

"I understand."

"The suppression isn't perfect. Sometimes fragments come back. Emotional echoes, sensory triggers. You might smell something or hear something and feel... something. But you won't know why."

"I said I understand." His voice had an edge now, impatience cutting through the exhaustion.

I didn't push it. "I need you to focus on the memory you want extracted. Bring it to the front of your mind. Play it through from beginning to end. The more vividly you can recall it, the cleaner the extraction."

His hands gripped the armrests, knuckles whitening. "How long does it take?"

"Depends on the memory. A single event, maybe twenty minutes. Something longer, more complex..." I shrugged. "We'll see."

I moved to the control console and brought the system online. The monitors lit up with his neural activity, a constellation of firing synapses rendered in blue and white. His hippocampus was already active, memory centers lighting up as he focused on whatever he wanted to forget.

"Beginning extraction in three... two... one."

The machine hummed to life, a sound like distant thunder. On the screens, I watched the memory begin to take shape—not in images, not yet, but in patterns. The temporal markers appeared first, and I felt my stomach drop.

The date read six months in the future.

I blinked, checked the calibration. The system was reading correctly. All seventeen interface points were functioning normally. But the timestamp didn't make sense. Memories were records of the past, neural imprints of experiences already lived. They had dates, contexts, temporal anchors that placed them in the architecture of a person's life history.

This memory was dated October 15th. It was currently April 23rd.

"There's something wrong with the calibration," I said, keeping my voice level. "I need to—"

"No." James's voice cut through the hum. "Don't stop. Extract it."

"The temporal markers are showing—"

"I know what they're showing. Extract it anyway."

I looked at him, really looked at him, and saw something in his eyes that made my mouth go dry. Not fear. Not guilt. Something closer to resignation. Acceptance.

"What is this?" I asked.

"You said no questions."

"That was before—"

"Fifty thousand dollars, Drake. Do your job."

I should have stopped. Should have shut down the system, told him to leave, erased all records of his visit. But fifty thousand dollars was fifty thousand dollars, and I'd learned a long time ago that the only thing more dangerous than knowing too much was being too curious about the wrong things.

I turned back to the console and continued the extraction.

The memory began to render in full sensory detail. I didn't usually watch the extractions play out—it felt like a violation, even in a profession built on violations—but this time I couldn't look away.

The scene materialized on my monitors in first-person perspective, experienced through James's eyes. A penthouse apartment, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Seattle skyline. Rain streaking the glass, the city lights below haloed in moisture. Expensive furniture, the kind you saw in architecture magazines. And a woman.

She was in her thirties, dark hair, wearing a black dress that cost more than my entire setup. She was turned away from James, looking out at the city, and there was something about her posture—tense, expectant—that suggested an argument had just ended or was about to begin.

In the memory, James moved toward her. His hands were steady, no trembling, no hesitation. He reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a gun.

The woman turned, and her eyes went wide. She started to speak, started to raise her hands, but James didn't wait. Three shots, center mass, professional and efficient. The sound was muffled by a suppressor I hadn't noticed him attach. The woman collapsed, and James stood there for a moment, watching her die, before calmly walking to the wet bar and pouring himself a drink.

The memory ended.

I stood there, staring at the monitors, my heart hammering against my ribs. The extraction was complete. The quantum drive had captured everything—the visual details, the auditory information, the proprioceptive sensation of firing the gun, the emotional flatness that had accompanied the act. No rage, no passion. Just cold, methodical murder.

And it was dated six months from now.

"Is it done?" James's voice was quiet.

I turned to look at him. He was sitting in the chair, the neural leads still attached, eyes closed. The chemical suppression had already begun, flooding his system with the compounds that would wall off the neural pathways I'd just mapped. In a few minutes, he wouldn't be able to remember what he'd just forced himself to relive.

"It's done," I said.

I removed the leads one by one, my hands moving on autopilot while my mind raced. This didn't make sense. Couldn't make sense. Memories were records, not predictions. The human brain didn't generate future experiences, couldn't create sensory-complete narratives of things that hadn't happened yet.

Unless.

Unless they had happened, somehow. Or would happen. Or—

"The drive," James said, standing up. His legs were unsteady, the usual side effect of extraction. "I want it."

"That's not how this works. The drives stay with me. Client confidentiality."

"I'm paying you another fifty thousand for the drive."

He pulled out another credit stick, and I felt the weight of it like a physical thing. One hundred thousand dollars total. More money than I'd made in the last six months combined.

"Why?" I asked.

"Because it's mine. My memory, my property."

"No." The word came out harder than I intended. "The extracted memories stay in my possession. That's the deal. That's how I guarantee no one else sees them."

"I could just take it."

I let my hand drift to the stunner in my belt. "You could try."

We stared at each other for a long moment. The rain hammered against the building above us, a sound like static. Finally, James laughed, a sound without humor.

"You're going to watch it, aren't you? You're going to wonder."

"I don't watch client extractions."

"Liar." He moved toward the door, still unsteady but determined. "Keep it, then. Keep the memory. But let me give you some advice, Drake. Some things are better left forgotten. By everyone."

He was gone before I could respond, footsteps echoing back up the stairwell, leaving me alone with the humming machines and a memory that couldn't exist.

I should have deleted it. Should have wiped the drive, degaussed it for good measure, pretended this whole night never happened. That was the smart play, the safe play.

Instead, I pulled up the file and watched it again.

The penthouse. The woman. The gun. Three shots, efficient and cold. The temporal marker still reading October 15th, still six months away.

I ran diagnostics on the extraction equipment. Everything checked out. No malfunctions, no data corruption, no temporal anomalies in the recording process. The memory was exactly what it appeared to be: a fully-formed, sensory-complete recollection of an event that hadn't happened yet.

Which meant either my equipment was fundamentally broken in a way that didn't show up on any diagnostic test, or James had somehow experienced something impossible.

Or there was a third option. One I didn't want to consider.

I saved the file to a secure partition, encrypted it with a key only I knew, and backed it up to three separate drives. Then I did something I hadn't done in years: I started a research file.

The woman in the memory. I'd only seen her face for a second before James shot her, but it was enough. High cheekbones, distinctive features, the kind of face that belonged to someone important. I pulled up facial recognition software—another tool left over from my previous life—and began running searches.

It took forty minutes, but I found her.

Catherine Reeves. Daughter of Senator Elizabeth Reeves. Heiress to the Reeves Technology fortune. Thirty-four years old, unmarried, served on the boards of half a dozen tech companies and charitable foundations. The kind of person whose death would make national news.

I pulled up her social media, her public appearances, looking for any connection to James. Nothing obvious, but then again, people like that didn't advertise their associations. They had private meetings, unlisted numbers, arrangements that never made it into public records.

The smart thing to do was still to delete everything. Forget I'd ever seen James or his impossible memory. Take the fifty thousand and move on to the next client, the next extraction, the next sin I could help someone bury.

But I'd spent five years pulling memories out of people's heads. I'd seen confessions of murder, abuse, betrayal. I'd extracted the memories of soldiers who'd committed war crimes, businessmen who'd ruined lives, ordinary people who'd done extraordinary terrible things. I'd taken their guilt and locked it away, let them walk free while their victims stayed broken.

I'd told myself it was a service. That people deserved the chance to move on, to heal, even if healing meant forgetting. That it wasn't my place to judge, only to perform a technical procedure.

But this was different.

This was a memory of a crime that hadn't been committed yet. A murder six months in the future, planned and executed with cold precision. If I deleted it, if I let it go, Catherine Reeves would die. I'd seen it happen, watched through James's eyes as he pulled the trigger.

And I'd done nothing.

The rain outside had finally started to let up, the hammering reduced to a steady patter. Through the small window near the ceiling, I could see the first hint of dawn turning the sky from black to gray. In a few hours, the city would wake up, and life would continue as if this night had never happened.

I pulled out a fresh drive and copied the file again. This copy wouldn't stay in the lab. I'd take it with me, keep it somewhere safe, somewhere I could access it if I needed to.

Because I was going to investigate.

I was going to find out who James really was, how he'd experienced a memory of the future, and whether Catherine Reeves was really going to die in six months. And if she was, I was going to figure out how to stop it.

It was a stupid decision, probably a fatal one. People who could afford my services had the kind of power and resources that made people like me disappear without a trace. James had already demonstrated he was capable of murder—would be capable of it, in six months—and I'd just made myself a liability.

But I'd spent five years helping people forget their crimes. Maybe it was time I helped prevent one instead.

I shut down the system, secured the lab, and headed up to the street level. The rain had stopped completely now, leaving the city washed clean and glistening in the early morning light. My car was parked two blocks away, and I walked slowly, feeling the weight of the encrypted drive in my pocket.

Somewhere in this city, James was probably sleeping soundly, freed from the burden of a memory he couldn't explain. And somewhere else, Catherine Reeves was going about her life, unaware that in six months, she was scheduled to die.

I'd spent my entire career in the business of forgetting.

Now I was in the business of remembering.

And I had six months to figure out how to change the future.
