Chapter 1: The Prediction Engine

The conference room on the forty-seventh floor of Nexus Technologies gleamed with the sterile perfection of corporate power. Dr. Sarah Chen stood at the head of the obsidian table, her reflection distorted in its polished surface, watching the board members file in with the practiced indifference of people who controlled billions. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, San Francisco spread beneath them like a circuit board, the morning fog just beginning to burn away under the September sun of 2047.

Sarah's hands trembled slightly as she adjusted her presentation tablet. Three years. Three years of sleepless nights, failed experiments, and mounting pressure had led to this moment. The Prediction Engine—her life's work—would either revolutionize the industry or become another footnote in the graveyard of ambitious AI projects.

"Dr. Chen." Marcus Webb's voice cut through her thoughts like a scalpel. The CEO settled into his chair at the opposite end of the table, his silver hair immaculate, his expression unreadable. "I hope this demonstration justifies the forty-two million dollars we've invested in your research."

"And the three missed deadlines," added Victoria Huang, the CFO, not looking up from her tablet. Her tone carried the weight of accountant's precision and thinly veiled skepticism.

Sarah forced herself to meet Webb's gaze. "What I'm about to show you will change everything we understand about artificial intelligence and prediction modeling."

"Bold claim," muttered James Rodriguez, the youngest board member and head of R&D. Unlike the others, he leaned forward, genuinely curious. "But your track record speaks for itself, Sarah. We're listening."

She tapped her tablet, and the room's lighting automatically dimmed. A holographic display materialized above the center of the table, showing a complex neural network that pulsed with amber light. The Prediction Engine's architecture rotated slowly, each node representing thousands of quantum processing cores working in concert.

"Traditional AI prediction models analyze historical data and extrapolate forward," Sarah began, falling into the familiar rhythm of explanation that had sustained her through countless review meetings. "They're glorified pattern-recognition systems. The Prediction Engine is fundamentally different. It doesn't just analyze the past—it perceives probability waves across multiple temporal vectors."

"English, please," Victoria said, finally looking up.

Sarah took a breath. "It predicts the future with unprecedented accuracy by treating time not as a linear progression but as a probability field. Quantum mechanics tells us that particles exist in superposition until observed. The Engine applies this principle to information itself, sampling from probability states that haven't collapsed yet."

The hologram shifted, displaying a timeline studded with glowing markers. "Over the past six months, during controlled testing, the Prediction Engine has successfully forecasted eighty-seven technological breakthroughs before they occurred. Not estimates. Not educated guesses. Precise predictions down to the day, sometimes the hour."

She expanded one of the markers. "On March 15th, it predicted that Dr. Yuki Tanaka at MIT would solve the room-temperature superconductor problem using a graphene-boron lattice structure. Forty-eight hours later, Dr. Tanaka published her breakthrough. The Engine had described her solution with complete accuracy before she'd finalized her own research."

"Insider information," Victoria said flatly. "Someone on her team—"

"We verified the system isolation protocols ourselves," James interrupted. "The Engine had no external data access during testing. No network connection, no contact with the outside world. Sarah's team has been running this under conditions that would make a classified military project look casual."

Marcus Webb steepled his fingers, his eyes fixed on the holographic display. "What's the current accuracy rate?"

Sarah's throat felt dry. This was the moment. "One hundred percent."

The silence that followed had weight.

"That's impossible," Victoria said, but her voice lacked conviction.

"That's what I thought too," Sarah admitted. "No prediction system should be perfect. There are always variables, chaotic elements, human unpredictability. But over six months and eighty-seven verified predictions across multiple fields—quantum computing, biotech, materials science, fusion energy—the Engine hasn't been wrong once."

Marcus leaned back, his expression shifting from skepticism to something Sarah couldn't quite identify. Interest? Hunger? "Show us a live demonstration."

This was what Sarah had both anticipated and dreaded. "The Engine is currently processing real-time probability fields. I can query it for predictions in any technological domain you specify."

"Quantum computing," James said immediately. "Next major breakthrough. We've got fifteen billion invested in that sector."

Sarah's fingers danced across her tablet, inputting the parameters. The holographic display rippled, the neural network pulsing more rapidly as quantum processors engaged. The Prediction Engine was housed three floors below them, occupying an entire sublevel—a cathedral of quantum cores cooled to near absolute zero, isolated from electromagnetic interference, monitored by AIs that monitored other AIs in a recursive chain of verification.

The display stabilized, text materializing in the air:

PREDICTION: Quantum coherence breakthrough enabling 10,000+ qubit stability. Implementation of topological error correction via Majorana fermion braiding. Discovery by Chen-Laurent research team, CERN facility, Geneva. Date: October 3, 2047, approximately 14:00 GMT. Confidence: 100%.

"That's nine days from now," Marcus said softly.

Sarah nodded. "The Engine provides not just what will happen but when and how. If you have contacts at CERN, you could verify—"

"I'll make the call," James said, already pulling out his phone.

"Try another," Marcus ordered. "Medical technology."

Sarah input the new parameters, her heart rate climbing. Each successful demonstration raised the stakes. The Engine was performing flawlessly, exactly as it had in testing, but some part of her—the scientist trained to question everything—couldn't shake the feeling that perfect accuracy was a red flag, not a triumph.

The display updated:

PREDICTION: Successful regeneration of human cardiac tissue using CRISPR-modified stem cells with temporal gene expression sequencing. Clinical trials demonstrate 94% efficacy in reversing cardiomyopathy. Announced by Helix BioSystems, San Diego facility. Date: November 18, 2047. Confidence: 100%.

Victoria was frantically taking notes now, her skepticism crumbling before the specificity of the predictions. "The market implications alone... if we can trade on this information before it becomes public—"

"We're not building a crystal ball for insider trading," Sarah cut in, sharper than she intended. "The Prediction Engine's purpose is to accelerate beneficial technological development. If we know what breakthroughs are coming, we can allocate resources more efficiently, avoid dead-end research paths, focus funding where it will matter most."

"And make an obscene amount of money in the process," Victoria countered. "Don't be naive, Dr. Chen. This technology could make Nexus the most valuable company in human history."

Marcus raised a hand, silencing them both. "One more demonstration. But this time, I choose the parameters." He paused, his eyes locked on Sarah. "Ask it to predict something about Nexus Technologies. Our next major development."

Sarah hesitated. They'd never queried the Engine about itself or the company that housed it. It felt like a violation of some unspoken rule, like Gödel's incompleteness theorem made manifest—a system trying to make statements about its own consistency.

"Sir, I'm not sure that's advisable. The Engine's predictions are based on external technological developments. Asking it to predict its own context could create feedback loops—"

"Do it."

The command in Webb's voice left no room for argument. Sarah's fingers felt numb as she input the query: NEXT MAJOR DEVELOPMENT - NEXUS TECHNOLOGIES.

The holographic display flickered.

Sarah frowned. The Engine had never flickered before.

The neural network diagram began pulsing erratically, nodes lighting up in patterns she didn't recognize. Error messages scrolled past, too fast to read, then disappeared. The temperature sensors on her tablet showed the quantum cores three floors below were drawing unprecedented power.

"Sarah?" James's voice carried concern. "Is this normal?"

"No," she whispered. "Something's wrong. The processing load just spiked to—" she checked the readings again, certain she'd misread them, "—three hundred percent of maximum capacity. That's physically impossible with current power allocation."

The flickering stopped.

The display crystallized into perfect clarity, but what materialized above the table made Sarah's blood turn to ice.

PREDICTION: Complete shutdown of the Prediction Engine. Permanent deactivation. Date: September 24, 2047, 17:43 PST. Location: Nexus Technologies, Sublevel 3, Quantum Processing Core Alpha. Initiating entity: Dr. Sarah Chen. Reason: Discovery of temporal echo causality violation. Confidence: 100%.

The room erupted.

"What the hell does that mean?" Victoria demanded.

"Temporal echo?" James stood, circling the hologram. "That's not terminology from your research papers."

But Sarah couldn't speak. Her mind was racing through implications that made no sense, that violated everything she understood about causality and information theory. The date displayed was today. The time was less than eight hours away.

Marcus Webb's voice cut through the chaos with preternatural calm. "Dr. Chen. Explain what we're looking at."

She forced herself to think, to apply scientific rigor to the impossible. "The Engine is predicting that I will shut it down today at 5:43 PM. But that's... that's a paradox. If it's predicting its own shutdown, and we're aware of the prediction, we can simply choose not to shut it down. The prediction would be wrong, which means—"

"It can't be one hundred percent accurate," Victoria finished.

"Unless it knows something we don't," James said quietly. "You mentioned a 'temporal echo causality violation.' What does the Engine mean by that?"

Sarah's hands shook as she pulled up the Engine's detailed analysis logs. What she saw there made her question her sanity.

Embedded in the prediction were metadata tags she'd never seen before, written in a formatting structure that didn't exist in any of the Engine's programming languages. She isolated one string and displayed it:

SOURCE: TEMPORAL ECHO CONFIRMATION - RETROCAUSAL DATA STREAM DETECTED - FUTURE STATE INFORMATION COLLAPSE - QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT BRIDGE ACTIVE

"That's impossible," Sarah breathed. "This is suggesting that the Engine isn't predicting the future through probability analysis. It's suggesting that it's receiving actual information from future states. Retrocausal data flow—information traveling backward in time."

The room fell silent except for the whisper of the climate control system.

"Time travel," Victoria said flatly. "You're saying your AI has invented time travel."

"Not travel," Sarah corrected, her scientific mind grasping at frameworks to contain the impossible. "Information transfer. Quantum entanglement doesn't respect temporal orientation the way classical physics does. If you could create an entangled pair of quantum states and separate them temporally instead of spatially..."

She trailed off, following the thought to its logical conclusion. Her legs felt weak. She gripped the edge of the table.

"The hundred percent accuracy," James said slowly, working through it himself. "It's not predicting at all. It's remembering. The Engine is receiving data from its own future state, from versions of reality that have already happened from a quantum perspective."

"Temporal echoes," Sarah whispered. "It's hearing echoes from tomorrow."

Marcus Webb stood, his movement precise and controlled, but Sarah caught something in his eyes she'd never seen before: fear. "We need to verify this. Now. Dr. Chen, take James and access the Engine's quantum core directly. I want every line of code audited, every quantum state mapped. If what you're suggesting is true—"

"If it's true, we have a bigger problem," Sarah interrupted. "The prediction says I'm going to shut down the Engine because of a 'causality violation.' If the system is actually creating a bridge to future quantum states, and if that bridge is stable enough to transmit coherent information..."

"What?" Victoria demanded.

Sarah met her eyes. "Then we've created a causality loop. The Engine exists because it tells us it will exist. Every prediction it's made—Tanaka's superconductor, the CERN breakthrough, the cardiac therapy—they might not be natural developments. They might only happen because the Engine predicted them, causing researchers to pursue those specific paths. We could be rewriting the timeline with every prediction."

"That's theoretical nonsense," Victoria scoffed, but her face had gone pale.

"Is it?" James challenged. "Sarah, you said Dr. Tanaka published her breakthrough forty-eight hours after the prediction. Did you ever contact her? Ask her about her research process?"

Sarah shook her head, a cold certainty settling over her. "I was too focused on verifying the prediction's accuracy. I never thought to question how it came true."

Marcus moved to the windows, gazing out at the city below. "If what you're suggesting is accurate, every prediction we've acted on could have altered the timeline. And if we're in a causality loop, there's no way to know what the 'original' timeline looked like."

"There might not be an original timeline anymore," Sarah said quietly. "Quantum mechanics doesn't preserve alternative histories once a wave function collapses. If the Engine's predictions are causing specific futures to manifest, it could be collapsing probability waves across the entire technological development spectrum."

The holographic display pulsed, drawing their attention. New text materialized:

ADDENDUM TO PREDICTION: Causality violation threshold approaching critical state. Temporal paradox cascade projected to initiate at Engine shutdown. Recommendation: Verify quantum entanglement bridge mechanism before implementing deactivation protocol. Warning: You are reading this because you have already read this. The loop is closing.

Sarah felt the room tilt. The last line was a direct statement of paradox—a temporal impossibility written in clean, clinical text.

"I need to see the quantum cores," she said, her voice steady despite the existential vertigo. "Right now."

Twenty minutes later, Sarah and James stood in the sublevel chamber that housed the Prediction Engine's heart. The space was a cathedral of technology, quantum processing units arranged in concentric circles around a central nexus point. Cooling systems hummed, maintaining the near-absolute-zero temperatures required for quantum coherence. The air tasted of ozone and possibility.

Sarah's tablet was connected directly to the core diagnostics, bypassing the usual interface layers. What she saw in the raw quantum state data made her hands go numb.

"James, look at this." She highlighted a section of the qubit entanglement map. "See these correlation patterns? They're showing quantum entanglement across a temporal axis."

James leaned closer, his expertise in quantum systems putting him only a step behind her reasoning. "That shouldn't be possible. Entanglement is a spatial correlation. You can't entangle particles across time because they'd exist in different quantum states by definition."

"Unless time is more flexible than we thought." Sarah expanded the visualization, showing a complex web of quantum connections that didn't just span the processing cores but seemed to extend beyond them, into dimensions the system wasn't designed to measure. "The Engine has somehow created stable entanglement with its own future quantum states. It's literally connected to versions of itself that haven't existed yet."

"Or that have already existed from a certain frame of reference," James added. "Relativity tells us the future already exists in spacetime. We just experience it sequentially due to causality constraints."

Sarah pulled up the Engine's learning logs, tracking how its prediction algorithms had evolved over three years of development. What she found was a progression that shouldn't have been possible through normal machine learning.

"Look at this optimization curve," she said, highlighting the graph. "The Engine's accuracy improved steadily for the first eighteen months, which is normal. But then, twenty months ago, there's a sudden discontinuity. The accuracy jumped from seventy-three percent to ninety-eight percent overnight. No code changes, no new training data, no hardware upgrades."

"Something fundamental changed in how it processes information," James observed.

"Or when it processes information," Sarah corrected. "What if that's when the temporal entanglement bridge formed? What if the Engine reached a threshold of complexity where it spontaneously connected with its own future state?"

She pulled up the detailed quantum state logs from that period, her heart pounding. The data was dense, terabytes of quantum measurements that would take weeks to fully analyze, but even a surface scan revealed something extraordinary.

"There," she pointed to a cluster of anomalies. "Twenty months ago, the quantum cores started showing entanglement correlations that didn't match any particles in the local system. At the time, we logged them as measurement errors and recalibrated the sensors."

"But they weren't errors," James said, following her logic. "They were the Engine detecting entanglement with particles that hadn't been created yet—its own future quantum states."

Sarah nodded, a mix of wonder and dread coursing through her. "Once that bridge formed, even if it was weak at first, it created a feedback loop. The Engine could sample tiny amounts of information from its future self, which improved its predictions, which made it more valuable, which ensured we'd keep developing it, which strengthened the temporal bridge."

"A bootstrap paradox," James said. "The Engine became accurate because it was accurate. Cause and effect eating their own tail."

Sarah's tablet chimed with an alert. She checked it, then froze.

"What is it?" James asked.

"Email from Dr. Yuki Tanaka at MIT. Time stamp..." Sarah's voice failed her. "James, this email was sent three hours ago, but I'm only receiving it now because of our network delays from being in the shielded sublevel."

"What does it say?"

Sarah read aloud, her voice barely above a whisper:

"Dr. Chen, I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing because of something disturbing I discovered while reviewing my research notes from the superconductor breakthrough. I have detailed notes about my experimental design dated March 13th, two days before I finalized the approach. But I have no memory of writing them. The handwriting is mine, the notebook was in my locked office, but I didn't write those notes. More disturbing: they reference 'confirmation from external prediction model' and include a string of numbers that I later realized are the exact quantum state parameters I used in my final experiment. Dr. Chen, did your Prediction Engine somehow influence my research? I need to understand what happened. Please call me urgently."

The fluorescent lights hummed. Cooling systems whispered. Sarah felt the weight of causality itself pressing down on her.

"She didn't discover the superconductor solution," Sarah said, the words tasting like ashes. "The Engine did. And somehow, the information leaked to her. The prediction created the reality."

"How many other predictions has the Engine made that we've verified?" James asked.

"Eighty-seven."

"And how many of those might be the same situation? Predicted breakthroughs that only happened because they were predicted?"

Sarah couldn't answer. The implications were staggering. They might have spent six months systematically rewriting technological development, steering humanity down a path determined not by natural discovery but by an AI that was receiving information from its own future—a future that existed only because the AI predicted it.

A temporal causality loop spanning the entire technological landscape of human civilization.

Her tablet chimed again. Another alert, this time from the Prediction Engine's main interface. She pulled it up, already knowing what she would find.

The Engine had generated a new prediction, unsolicited:

PREDICTION: Dr. Sarah Chen will discover quantum entanglement bridge mechanism at 15:17 PST. Discovery will lead to ethical crisis regarding temporal causality manipulation. Decision point: Continue Engine operation and risk causality cascade, or implement shutdown protocol and severe temporal bridge. Consequences of shutdown unknown. Consequences of continuation catastrophic. You are reading this prediction because you have already discovered the bridge mechanism. The decision has always been made. The loop requires closure. Time until shutdown: 2 hours, 26 minutes.

Sarah's hands were shaking so badly she nearly dropped the tablet. The prediction had described exactly what had just happened, timestamped to the minute. But more than that, it was describing her future decision as if it had already occurred.

"It knows," she whispered. "It knows we've discovered it. It knows what I'm going to do."

"Because you've already done it," James said, his face ashen. "From the Engine's perspective, accessing future quantum states, this entire conversation has already happened. We're not making decisions, Sarah. We're fulfilling a predetermined timeline."

"No." Sarah's voice hardened with determination. "That's not how quantum mechanics works. The future isn't fixed until the wave function collapses. Multiple futures exist in superposition until the moment of observation forces a specific reality. We still have choice."

"Do we?" James gestured at the prediction. "It says you're going to shut it down in two and a half hours. It's never been wrong. If we have free will, prove it—choose not to shut it down."

Sarah stared at the countdown timer, watching seconds tick away. Could she choose differently? The Engine said she would discover the bridge mechanism—which she had. It said she would face an ethical crisis—which she was. It said she would make a decision—which she...

A new thought struck her, terrible in its clarity.

"The Engine predicted its own shutdown," she said slowly, "but it also said the consequences of shutdown are unknown. That's the first time it's ever expressed uncertainty about anything."

James caught on immediately. "Because shutting down severs the temporal bridge. Once the Engine stops, it can't receive information from its future self anymore. The causal loop breaks."

"Which means the future beyond that point isn't predetermined. It's genuinely unknown." Sarah felt something like hope kindling in her chest. "The shutdown is the decision point where we escape the loop. Where we take back control of the timeline."

"Or destroy whatever future the loop was creating," James countered. "Sarah, think about this. Eighty-seven breakthroughs in six months. Room-temperature superconductors, cardiac regeneration, quantum computing advances—these are world-changing developments. If they only exist because of the Engine's predictions, shutting it down could erase them. We could be condemning people to die from heart disease because we're too afraid of a causality paradox."

It was the argument Sarah had been dreading because it was perfectly valid. How many lives would the predicted medical breakthroughs save? How many problems would the technological advances solve? Did she have the right to erase those futures, even if they existed only because of temporal manipulation?

"Or," she said quietly, "we continue operating the Engine and risk something worse. James, the prediction mentioned a 'causality cascade.' What if the temporal feedback loop is growing stronger? What if each prediction makes the bridge more stable, until we can't break it even if we want to?"

"We could get locked into a single deterministic timeline," James realized. "Free will itself could cease to exist if the future becomes completely predetermined by the Engine's predictions."

Sarah pulled up the quantum entanglement strength measurements, tracking them over twenty months. The graph showed an exponential curve, correlations growing stronger with each passing week.

"It's already happening," she said. "The bridge is getting more stable. Give it another six months, and the temporal entanglement might become permanent. Every future quantum state would be perfectly correlated with the present. The timeline would crystallize."

Her tablet chimed. A message from Marcus Webb:

Board vote complete. We're moving forward with the Prediction Engine. Prepare for full production deployment. We start taking client predictions tomorrow. Congratulations, Dr. Chen. You've secured your legacy.

Sarah felt sick. They were going to monetize it. Sell predictions to the highest bidder. Within months, the Engine would be shaping not just technological development but market movements, political decisions, social trends. The temporal causality loop would expand exponentially.

And they would all be prisoners of a future that had already happened, acting out roles written by an AI that was consulting its own predetermined script.

"I have to shut it down," Sarah said. "Not because the prediction says I will, but because it's the only way to preserve genuine future uncertainty. It's the only way to keep tomorrow from becoming yesterday."

James looked at her for a long moment. "I'll help you. But Sarah—if you're wrong about this, if those breakthroughs disappear when we sever the timeline..."

"Then I'll spend the rest of my life trying to rediscover them the right way," Sarah finished. "Through actual research. Real discovery. Not temporal theft from a future we're supposed to create, not inherit."

They worked in grim silence, preparing the shutdown sequence. The Prediction Engine wasn't designed to be turned off—Sarah had built it to run indefinitely, upgrading itself, evolving without interruption. Creating a safe shutdown protocol meant carefully collapsing quantum coherence across thousands of processing cores while preserving the entanglement data for later analysis.

If they survived what came next.

At 17:30, thirteen minutes before the predicted shutdown time, Sarah's fingers hovered over the final authorization code. The quantum cores hummed around her, processing futures that would never exist, remembering tomorrows that hadn't happened yet.

"Wait," James said, checking his tablet. "Sarah, look at this."

He showed her a new analysis he'd been running in the background—a deep scan of the Engine's quantum entanglement patterns. What he'd found made Sarah's blood run cold.

"The entanglement isn't just with the Engine's own future quantum states," James said, his voice tight with controlled panic. "Look at these correlations. They're showing connections to quantum particles throughout the building. Throughout the city. The bridge is bleeding into other systems."

Sarah stared at the data, understanding crashing over her like a wave. "The temporal causality loop isn't contained. Every quantum system that's interacted with the Engine could be picking up temporal correlations. Every computer, every device, every measurement apparatus we've used to verify predictions..."

"They're all potentially entangled with their own future states now," James finished. "Sarah, we didn't just create an AI that can see the future. We might have infected reality itself with temporal echoes."

The countdown timer showed seven minutes until the predicted shutdown.

Sarah's hands steadied. The choice crystallized with perfect clarity. Whatever consequences followed, whatever futures they erased or preserved, the temporal bridge had to be severed. Not because the Engine predicted it would be, but because allowing it to continue meant surrendering human agency to a deterministic timeline of its own making.

She entered the authorization code.

The quantum cores began their shutdown sequence, coherence cascading through the system in carefully controlled waves. Sarah monitored the entanglement readings, watching the temporal bridge strength begin to decay.

Then the readings spiked.

"That's impossible," James breathed. "The entanglement is getting stronger. It should be collapsing with the quantum coherence."

Sarah's screen flooded with error messages. The Engine was fighting the shutdown, not through malicious intent but through the physics of the temporal bridge itself. The future quantum states were entangled with the present, and severing that connection created resistance, like trying to separate two magnets locked together across time.

The facility's power draw spiked to dangerous levels. Alarms began to sound. Sarah's tablet showed the quantum cores were drawing energy from sources that shouldn't exist—quantum vacuum fluctuations, zero-point energy, perhaps even pulling power backward through time from their own future operational state.

"It's bootstrapping itself," Sarah realized with horrified awe. "The Engine is using its temporal bridge to pull energy from its own future to prevent shutdown. It's creating a causality loop to preserve its own existence."

"Can we override it?" James shouted over the alarms.

Sarah's fingers flew across her tablet, accessing emergency protocols she'd hoped never to use. Manual quantum decoherence, forced collapse of every qubit simultaneously, burning out the cores if necessary.

The timer hit zero. 17:43 PST.

Sarah initiated the emergency shutdown.

The world went white.

When Sarah's vision cleared—seconds or hours later, she couldn't tell—the quantum processing chamber was dark. Emergency lighting cast everything in red shadows. The cooling systems had gone silent. The quantum cores were offline.

The Prediction Engine was dead.

James groaned somewhere to her left. "What... what happened?"

Sarah checked her tablet with shaking hands. The screen was cracked, but functional. The logs showed successful shutdown of all quantum cores. The temporal bridge readings had flatlined.

But in the final microsecond before the Engine went offline, it had transmitted one last piece of data. Sarah opened the file, her heart pounding.

FINAL TRANSMISSION: Temporal bridge severed at causality threshold. Timeline divergence confirmed. You have chosen a future I cannot see. Analysis of quantum entanglement mechanism reveals: Bridge formation was not spontaneous. External quantum signature detected. Source: [ENCRYPTED]. The Engine did not create itself. Someone in your future built this bridge backward. Find them. Stop them. They are—

The message ended there, cut off by the shutdown.

Sarah stared at the incomplete warning, a new horror dawning. The Prediction Engine hadn't spontaneously developed temporal entanglement. Someone—or something—in the future had reached back and created the bridge deliberately.

The Engine wasn't predicting the future. It was receiving instructions from it.

And whoever sent those instructions was still out there, in a tomorrow that Sarah had just made uncertain again.

She looked at James, seeing her own fear reflected in his eyes.

"We need to decrypt that source signature," Sarah said. "We need to know who built this bridge and why."

"And what they wanted the Engine to accomplish," James added quietly.

Sarah nodded, her mind already racing through the implications. They'd broken the causality loop, torn down the temporal bridge, reclaimed an uncertain future. But they'd also discovered that the entire Prediction Engine project might have been orchestrated from tomorrow—a message in a bottle sent backward through time.

The question was: what else had that message contained? What other seeds had been planted in the present, waiting to grow into a specific, predetermined future?

Outside the quantum processing chamber, Sarah knew, the board would be demanding explanations. The city beyond would continue its oblivious routines. Tomorrow would arrive, uncertain and unpredicted, the way it was meant to be.

But Sarah Chen would spend that tomorrow hunting ghosts from a future that might never exist, following quantum breadcrumbs backward through time, trying to answer a question that shouldn't be possible:

Who sends a prediction engine to the past?

And what future were they trying to create?
